What is the overlab between cf46 and cf47?
====

```{r}
library(survey)
svytable(~cf46+cf47, rchis)

table(is.na(chis$cf47) == is.na(chis$cf46))

referred.total <- sum(svytotal(~cf46, na.rm = T, design = rchis))
# sum(svytotal(~cf47, na.rm = T, design = rchis))

a <- svyby(~cf46, by = ~cf47, FUN = svytotal, design = rchis)
a
a/referred.total
confint(a)
confint(a)/referred.total
```
