This project examines data from the California Health Interview Survey 2009, Child Public Use File. We were interested to determine how child, family, and health system factors may affect referral for developmental services after controlling for the level of parent concern.

For the source data, visit: http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/chis/data/Pages/public-use-data.aspx 

I used the CHIS 2009 PUF Child file, Stata version.

See the R scripts under the Reproducible_Code directory for the analyses in the manuscript.
